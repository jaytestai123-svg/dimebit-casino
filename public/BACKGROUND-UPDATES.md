# BetBoost500 Background Enhancements

## Overview
Enhanced the landing page with full-background casino imagery, improved contrast for text elements, and optimized for readability.

## Changes Made

### Full Background Images
1. Added high-quality full-background casino images:
   - Hero section: Premium casino floor (luxury-casino-main.jpg)
   - How It Works: Casino chips close-up (casino-chips-bg.jpg)
   - Features: Casino lights and atmosphere (casino-lights-bg.jpg)
   - Social Proof: Gold playing cards (cards-gold-bg.jpg)
   - FAQ: Roulette table (casino-roulette-bg.jpg)
   - Final CTA: Slot machine wins (slots-win-bg.jpg)
   - Footer: Slot machine jackpot (slots-jackpot.jpg)

### Text Contrast Improvements
1. Added semi-transparent dark backgrounds with backdrop blur for text elements
2. Enhanced text shadow for better readability (0 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8))
3. Added gold glow effects to accent elements
4. Redesigned hero section with centered content panel for better focus

### Layout Updates
1. Removed hero side image in favor of full background approach
2. Added backdrop filters for blur effects on cards and panels
3. Increased contrast for all text elements against background images
4. Added subtle animations to gold elements (section dividers, borders)

### Technical Improvements
1. Added text-shadow properties to ensure readability on busy backgrounds
2. Increased base contrast of overlay gradients (rgba(0,0,0,0.7) to rgba(0,0,0,0.8))
3. Added semi-transparent dark overlays to ensure text legibility
4. Optimized background image placement with background-attachment: fixed for parallax effect

## Next Steps
1. Consider adding more dynamic elements:
   - Animated particles for casino chips or cards
   - Subtle movement in backgrounds (slight parallax)
   - Gold coin animations on hover
2. Optimize image loading with progressive JPEGs
3. Add preload for critical background images
